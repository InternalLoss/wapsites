# WAP Sites

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This repository houses various mini-sites for WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) devices, primarily written in PHP.

Each mini-site has it's own README, and unless otherwise licenced in that folder, is available with the MIT licence **under no warranty.** Eventually, I might get around to updating my WAP site!

## Credit

If you'd like to give credit on your WAP-enabled website, link to [wap.billy.wales](http://wap.billy.wales). On a 'normal' desktop site, this repository is fine. Generally, however, this is meant to be more about collaboration/sharing of my random ideas - make your own services and enjoy doing it! :)
